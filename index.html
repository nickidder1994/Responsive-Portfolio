        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="./assets/images/IMG_3714.JPEG">

        <p>My name is Nicholas Kidder, I am 24 years old. I have lived in Orange County, California my entire life.
            Currently, I work in a fabrication shop as welder but I discovered web/software development about a year
            ago
            and
            decided that that was the career I desired. I recently started going back to college as a computer
            science major and my goal is to transfer from the junior college that I am curently at to UCI to recive my
            degree.
            Some of
            my
            hobbies include, going to the gym, hiking, cooking, spending time with my family, my girlfriend, and my
            friends,
            and of course always trying to further my education and knowledge of new skills.</p>
        <p>One major aspect that attracted
            me to web development and the tech field in general is the fact that it's always growing and evolving so
            there
            will always be new skills and tools to learn. I love the satisfaction and the sense of pride that come
            when
            a
            line of code works and when it doesn't work, it may sound crazy, but I even love going back and looking
            for
            bugs
            in my code. I love problem solving, when I approach a problem or a bug in the code I like to look at it
            like
            a
            puzzle where every piece has to fit perfectly in order for it to work and come out the way you want.
